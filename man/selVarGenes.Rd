\description{
This function selects the most variable genes from a \code{SingleCellExperiment} object
  using the plot that displays the log2 coefficient of variation as a function of the log2 mean for 
  all genes across all the cells.
}
\details{
The function takes in a \code{SingleCellExperiment} object and calculates the normalized
  counts by dividing the raw counts by the corresponding sizeFactors per cell. Only genes that have
  an expression greater than or equal to \code{minExpr} in at least \code{minCells} cells will be
  kept.
  
  The genes that vary most on the log2(coefficient of variation) vs log2(mean) plot of genes will 
  be selected. A loess fit is done on this plot and the distance (euclidean by default) each point has
  to the curve is calculated in two steps.
  
  In the first step, genes are assigned to bins by taking the minimum distance to the curve. By default
  we select 100 points on the loess fit and calculate the distances each gene has to all those points on 
  the curve. Each gene is assigned to the point on the curve for which it has the shortest distance. In 
  the second step, more accurate distances to the curve are calculated by using a higher number of 
  points on the curve.
  
  Finally, for each bin, the most variable genes are selected using the more accurate distance
  measures. Genes that fall below the loess fit are assigned a negative sign and the genes that 
  are \code{Nmads} MADs away from the median are selected.
